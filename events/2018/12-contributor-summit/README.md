# 2018 Kubernetes Contributor Summit US

## What

The Contributor Summit brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors alike to connect and share face-to-face. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of community development and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.
The summit now spans two days; including an optional social event in the early evening of December 9th along with the main full-day event December 10th.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

- Cross-SIG communication and announcements
- Grow the number of new developers
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project

## Registration

- [Register for KubeCon/CloudNativeCon](https://www.regonline.com/registration/Checkin.aspx?EventID=2246960) and select the Contributor Summit from the list of co-located events

## Agenda

- Current Contributor Track - Talks, Workshops, Birds of a Feather, “Uncoferences”, Steering Committee Sessions, and more! For those that haven't been contributing to the project for for long, to the maintainers that have shepherded it since the beginning. There will be something here for you.
- Docs Sprint - Working on a curated list of issues and challenges that The Docs Team are tackling at that time.

Exact schedule will be posted soon!
